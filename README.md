[![Build Status](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/svg/4)](http://ci.cartalyst.com/build-status/view/4)

A framework agnostic measurement conversion and formatting package featuring multiple types of measurements and currency conversion.

The package requires PHP 5.3+ and comes bundled with a Laravel 4 Facade and a Service Provider to simplify the optional framework integration and follows the FIG standard PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code and is unit-tested.
